    <h2>Projects Page:</h2>

    <!-- Here is the markup for the ordered list that will display the info for my projects page -->
    <ol id="projects">
        <li>1: Business Button: located on the <a href="degrees.html">Degree Programs Page</a> - This button displays all the degree programs affiliated with the Business field.</li>
        <li>2: Technology Button: located on the <a href="degrees.html">Degree Programs Page</a> - This button displays all the degree programs affiliated with the Technology field.</li>
        <li>3: In-State-Calculator: located on the <a href="tuition.html">Tuition Page</a> - This calculator takes the number of semesters and outputs the in-state price.</li>
        <li>4: Out-of-State-Calculator: located on the <a href="tuition.html">Tuition Page</a> - This calculator takes the number of semesters and outputs the out-of-state price.</li>
        <li>5: Zip Code Rate Generator: located on the <a href="tuition.html">Tuition Page</a> - This input takes a zip code and determines whether the tuition rate is in or out of state.</li>
        <li>6: Frist, Last, Email, and Phone Number fields: located on the <a href="application.html">Tuition Page</a> - These inputs perform a validation check and provide a green or red checkmark to the user using the "focusout" event</li>
        <li>7: Student ID Generate Button: located on the <a href="application.html">Tuition Page</a> - This field is readonly and it will generate a 6 digit school ID number when the "generate" button is clicked.</li>
        <li>8: Select a Program Input: located on the <a href="application.html">Tuition Page</a> - This field will give the user a green checkmark when an option is selected.</li>
        <li>9: Submit Button: located on the <a href="application.html">Tuition Page</a> - This input type will run a final validation for the entire form and then provide a confirmation message to the user.</li>
        
        <li>Reflection: My goal here was to create a simple mockup of a college website. A challenge I faced was in my click event for my submitButton. I feel like the code is a bit repetative but it was the best I could do. The biggest challenge I had was the final validation for the entire form. I used multiple variables instead of one to check the validation. Overall it was a fun project!</li>
